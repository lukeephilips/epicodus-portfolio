# Portfolio
==========================

#### _It's my Portfolio_

#### By _**Luke Philips**_

## Description

Highlights some of my projects and shows all projects via an API call to GitHub. Uses Rails-admin to create an admin panel

Allows logged in user to access rails console, which doesn't really do anything since the API call is a PORO and everything else is static. I don't need a stinking admin panel anyway, I'm an engineer :)

To log in:
1. create user in rails console
2. visit /users/sign_in
3. navigate to /admin to use the panel

To log out:
click link in navbar

## Instructions:

* clone from Github, run bundle install, rails db:setup, serve with "rails server"
* open on localhost:3000
